# iot-status
Test Driven Development (TDD) method for IoT testability based on MQTT compatible with ESP32 Development Board

## Requirements

Google Colab application enabled on Google Drive, which is free to use.
Google Colab appears as one of Google Apps in Google Drive.

Arduino IDE on Computer, ESP32 Development Board such as Wemos or NodeMCU and USB cable for debugging and firmware deployment.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository (if you are using a browser, you can download this repository using "Code" -> "Download ZIP")

2. Download the Arduino files to your computer, and open these files with Arduino IDE.

3. Plug the ESP32 board with the USB cable, modify the WiFi credentials, then compile and deploy the Arduino script (also obtain the chipID in the serial monitor).

4. Upload the Python files (and associated files) to your Google Drive.

5. Use the Google Colab application to open and execute the Python notebooks (modify the chipID fields to match the ESP32 used).
